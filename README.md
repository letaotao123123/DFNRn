# DFNRn
This software is a Matlab toolbox for simulating radon migration in fractured rock masses.
This toolbox is a Matlab-Comsol interface for modeling radon migration in fractured rock masses. 
Install the installation toolbox DFNRn.mlappinstall in Matlab 2017b or later.
Enter the calculation parameters in input_parameters.xlsx, including: DFN model parameters, radon transport parameters. input_parameters.xlsx is placed in Matlab's working folder.
Before running DFNRn, open COMSOL Multiphysics by LiveLink for MATLAB.
The simulation results are automatically exported to Matlab's working folder, including: radon concentration distribution, radon flux distribution, average radon exhalation rate, maximum radon exhalation rate, minimum radon exhalation rate
All simulation results can be opened using ParaView 5.10.
For a detailed description of the DFNRn toolbox, see our forthcoming paper: Shengyang Feng, et al. Modelling radon migration in fractured rock masses based on discrete fracture network,2022.
