# DFNRn
A Matlab toolbox for simulating radon migration in fractured rock masses
This toolbox is a Matlab-Comsol interface for modeling radon migration in fractured rock masses. 
Install the installation toolbox DFNRn.mlappinstall in Matlab 2017b or later.
Enter the calculation parameters in input_parameters.xlsx, including: DFN model parameters, radon transport parameters. input_parameters.xlsx is placed in Matlab's working folder.
Before running DFNRn, open COMSOL Multiphysics by LiveLink for MATLAB.
The simulation results are automatically exported to Matlab's working folder, including: rock fracture medium radon concentration distribution, fracture radon concentration distribution, radon flux distribution, fracture radon flux distribution, average radon precipitation rate (radon concentration), maximum radon precipitation rate (radon concentration), minimum radon precipitation rate (radon concentration).
All calculations can be opened using ParaView 5.10.
For a detailed description of the DFNRn toolbox, see our forthcoming paper: Shengyang Feng, et al. DFNRn: a MATLAB-COMSOL toolbox for modelling radon migration in fractured rock masses,2022.
